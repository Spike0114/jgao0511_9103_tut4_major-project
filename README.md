# Major-project

## 1.Work Description
This work does not require mouse or keyboard interaction. After opening the webpage, wait for a few seconds, and the animation effect will automatically start and loop


## 2.Details of individual approach

### Method
I use Perlin noise and random values or seeds to drive animations

### Animation and differentiation
I choose to divide the entire shape into rectangles of the same size, and then let these rectangles move freely. After a period of time, these rectangles return to their original positions
The effect of my team member's code is that small squares move in an orderly manner and gradually disappear, and another effect is to use a mouse to control and change the position, color, and size of graphics


### Source of inspiration
My inspiration comes from the following works

From these two works, I learned about deconstruction and reconstruction, order and chaos, the opposition and unity between dynamic and static

Firstly, the splitting of 'Broadway Boogie woogie' into small squares and its movement represents a break from tradition and existing forms. By decomposing a fixed, static structure - Mondrian's geometric composition - into independent dynamic elements

After a period of movement, these blocks returned to their original positions, forming the original appearance of Mondrian's works This kind of regression is a process of reconstruction, which is the re establishment of order and the original state. This process implies the plasticity of art, that is, art works can reconstruct their original structure and meaning through decomposition and dynamic changes
